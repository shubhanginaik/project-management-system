# Prerequisites

-List the software and tools required to run the application.

- Java 17 or later
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL

- Postman
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
- Git
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Hibernate
- JPA (Java Persistence API)

# Getting Started

## Cloning the Repository
    
- Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nagadheerajb/fs19-java-backend.git
    ```
  
- Change the directory to the project root:
    ```bash
    cd fs19-java-backend
    ```

# Configuration

- Database Setup:

1. Configure the database in src/main/resources/application.properties:
- Initialize the database:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
    ```
  - Run the application
  - The application will automatically create the necessary tables in the database.
  - Once the database schema is created, stop the application and change the property to update:
    ```properties
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```
    - Run the application again to apply the changes.
    
    
- The application will start on port 8080 by default.
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.
- Use Postman or Swagger to test the API endpoints.


## Testing the application

-- put the property create in the application.properties file
- Run the application
- The application will automatically create the necessary tables in the database.
- run the test cases


# Code Structure

- The project follows a modular structure with separate packages for each layer:
- Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- Service Layer: Contains business logic.
- Application Layer: Contains DTOs, mappers, and other application-specific classes.
- Repository Layer: Interacts with the database using JPA.
- DTOs: Data transfer objects for request and response payloads.
- config: Contains configuration classes for Swagger, JWT, and other configurations.


# API Endpoints

Please find the API documentation in the `api-docs` folder.


## Team Collaboration Tools

- Trello:
-- Managed the project board with task assignments and status updates.
-- Used columns like To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done to track progress.
* Code Reviews:
-- Regular peer reviews to ensure clean, maintainable code.
-- Integrated code review checklists for consistency.
* Communication:
-- Daily stand-ups to synchronize progress.
-- Slack/Email for discussions and quick resolutions.

## Vision

You are required to build a fullstack project management system similar to Trello, Jira, or Monday.

The project can be single- or multi-tenant.

The main requirements are as follows:

- **User Management**
- **Projects and Workspaces**
- **Tasks and Issues**

To take the project to the next level, consider these additional requirements:

- **Collaboration**
- **Real-time Collaboration**
- **Integration with Other Platforms**
- **Reporting and Analytics**

### Business Requirements

- Brainstorm the backend design in terms of entity structure and how they will interact. 
- Discuss the implementation of architecture: CLEAN, DDD, TDD, and any possible pattern your team want to apply (repository pattern, CQRS, etc.).
- **Deadline Management**: Use any project management tool of your choice to ensure timely delivery.

## Requirements

_For team assignment, only 1 member should fork the repo, then the admin can invite other members to contribute in the same repo. The rest of the team members, must fork from the common repo(admin repo), making PRs against the common repo when changes are needed. Remember to have a develop branch before merging to main. Each feature/schema/bug/issue should have its own branch, and only one member should work on one branch/file at a time. Before making any new branch, make sure to sync the fork and run `git pull` to avoid conflicts with the common team repo._

1. **Create ERD Diagram** with entities, attributes, and relationships. Include the ERD as an image in the project.

2. **Design the API Endpoints** to follow REST API architecture. Document the endpoints in `.md` files, providing detailed explanations of queries, parameters, request bodies, authentication requirements (if applicable), sample responses, and status codes.

3. **Basic Entities** (Additional entities may be included as needed):
	Possible entities:
   - Tenant
   - User
   - Project
   - Workspace
   - Task
   - Role
   - Permission
   - Comment (optional)
   - Notification (optional)

4. **Develop Backend Server** using CLEAN Architecture:

   - Use exception handler to provide meaningful responses to users.
   - Unit testing is required primarily for the Domain and Service layers. It would be ideal to test also the controllers and data access.
   - The README file should clearly describe the project with sufficient detail and a readable structure.
